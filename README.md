##  Overview
This web-based interactive mapping application allows users to measure distances and calculate areas effortlessly. Built with **Leaflet.js** and **Leaflet Draw**, the tool supports:
- **Geolocation**
- **Location search**
- **Multiple map layers**
- **GeoJSON export**

Perfect for **GIS professionals**, **students**, and **mapping enthusiasts**!

##  Key Features
✅ **Distance Measurement**: Click on the map to add points and calculate distances in **kilometers, miles, or meters**.

✅ **Area Calculation**: Draw polygons and instantly get their area in **square kilometers**.

✅ **Location Search**: Use OpenStreetMap’s **Nominatim API** to find locations worldwide.

✅ **User Geolocation**: Detect and zoom to the user's current location with one click.

✅ **Export as GeoJSON**: Save drawn features in **GeoJSON** format for GIS applications.

##  Code Snippet (Adding a Map with Leaflet.js)
```javascript
let map = L.map('map').setView([24.7136, 46.6753], 6);
L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    attribution: '&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors'
}).addTo(map);
```
